Erickson rose through the ranks of CBC Manitoba first as an associate producer, local reporter and in 2004, she was appointed lead news anchor for CBC Manitoba\u2019s supper hour newscast, CBC News at Six. She remained a frequent contributor to network programs during this time, including CBC\u2019s newscast, The National and the network consumer affairs program, Marketplace.\nIn 2004, Erickson was nominated by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television for a Gemini Award in the category of Best Lifestyle\/Practical information segment for a reality TV style documentary she hosted and co-produced for Marketplace called, \"Love and Little White Lies\".\nIn 2006, she joined CBC's parliamentary bureau in Ottawa where she remained until leaving CBC for Sun News in 2010.\nIn 2008, she was accused of bias while covering the Mulroney-Schreiber hearings when she was accused of feeding questions to former Liberal Member of Parliament Pablo Rodriguez. An investigation by the CBC ombudsman cleared her of any charge of bias. However, Norman Spector wrote that \"Ms. Erickson and Mr. Richardson (a Conservative MP) were being seen together in Ottawa as early as the summer of 2008, but the relationship was not reported. Had Canadians known this in December of 2008, more of us may have questioned the story that Ms. Erickson had conspired with a Liberal MP against a former Conservative prime minister.\"  It is suggested that she was rewarded for having derailed the public conversation, winning employment opportunities in return.\nErickson promoted the launch of Sun News by appearing as a Sunshine Girl on the day of the channel's premiere.\nIn June 2011, an interview by Erickson of interpretive dancer Margie Gillis generated 6,676 complaints to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council due to what some viewed as Erickson's aggressive tone when she challenged Gllis to explain why artists like herself deserved public funding. The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council ruled that the interview did not violate the country's broadcast standards.\nIn January 2013, Erickson left Sun News Network and began working as a freelance foreign correspondent based in London and filed reports for CBS News. By the end of the year, she had left journalism for law school. She graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 2015 and a Master of Laws in 2017 from BPP Law School in London, England.",

Along with the Manresa-Berga railway (1885, closed down 1973), this contributed toward a flourishing textile industry, though this has now almost disappeared. In 1945 the extraction of the rich layers of potassium salts (sylvite and carnallite) started, and today this remains a major employer, but many other small and medium enterprises have also been created. There is also one of the major European production plants from Gates Corporation, an American manufacturer of power transmission belts and fluid power, employing about 240 people.\nOn 7 August 1963 the guerrilla leader Ramon Vila Capdevila -  the last of the Spanish Maquis to hold out since the end of the Spanish Civil War - was killed by Guardia Civil officers near a castle in Balsareny.",
