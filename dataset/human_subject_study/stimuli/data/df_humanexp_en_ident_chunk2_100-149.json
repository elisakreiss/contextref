The current lineup consists of Ryan Lindsey on guitar and vocals, Ben King on guitars, Penny Pitchlynn on bass and Nathan Price on drums.\nTheir debut album Can't Get Past the Lips originally came out in 2011 and was rereleased by Fairfax Recordings in 2013. Broncho released their second album Just Enough Hip to Be Woman on September 16, 2014 on Dine Alone Records. The album received generally favorable reviews from the music press.\nThe band's song \"It's On\" was played over the closing credits of \"Females Only,\" the first episode of the third season of the HBO series Girls.  \"Try Me Out Sometime\" was used in an advertisement for HBO Now and Movie 43. \"Try Me Out Sometime\" was also featured in the documentary, Valley Uprising. The track \"Class Historian\" was used in a commercial featuring Kate Hudson for her Fabletics brand of women's athletic clothing as well as Cartoon Network's bearstack campaign.  \"Class Historian\" also appears on the soundtrack for Vacation, as well as the second episode of the second season of Santa Clarita Diet. \"Boys Got to Go\" is featured on the soundtrack of the 2019 soccer video game, PES 2020.\nTheir fourth album \"Bad Behaviour\" came out in 2018. Described as slightly more \"pop\" than their previous efforts, it has been well received nonetheless.",
