The soundtrack for the film Midnight Express, which contained the international hit \"Chase\", won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. He also produced a number of electronic disco songs for the Three Degrees, two albums for Sparks, and a handful of songs on Bonnie Tyler's album Bitterblue as well as her 1985 single \"Here She Comes\". In 1990, he composed \"Un'estate italiana\", the official theme song of the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nHe has created a score of songs for many performers including David Bowie, Kylie Minogue, Irene Cara, Janet Jackson, Madleen Kane, Melissa Manchester, Blondie, Japan and France Joli. Moroder has stated that the work of which he is most proud is Berlin's \"Take My Breath Away\", which earned him two Golden Globes (for Best Original Score and Best Original Song) and the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1986; he had earned the same awards in 1983 for \"Flashdance... What a Feeling\". In addition to the three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes, Moroder has also received four Grammy Awards, two People's Choice Awards, and more than 100 Golden and Platinum discs.
